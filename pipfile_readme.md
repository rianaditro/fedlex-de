# pipenv

## PIP + venv = pipenv
Notice the additional pipfile? Its because I used pipenv instead of pip and venv.

## What is it?
It's just same package management tool like we usally use. This is just an alternative from `python -m venv venv` then `pip install -r requirements.txt` then activate the venv by `source Scripts/activate` what i did just `pipenv install` to create a virtual environment with its dependencies then `pipenv shell` to activate it

## What's Next?
Try to learn Poetry to publish your whole app (including all the third-party libraries) just by simply `pip install myApp`

Then learn docker, if you want to be a backend engineer, devops engineer or MLOps!

Good Luck!
